1. Exported Variables: 
   - `sections`: This variable will be an array of objects, each object representing a section of the website. It will be defined in `content.py` and used in `main.js` to dynamically generate the website content.

2. Data Schemas: 
   - `Section`: This schema will define the structure of each section object in the `sections` array. It will include properties like `name` and `content`.

3. ID Names of DOM Elements: 
   - `#home`, `#artists`, `#podcasts`, `#music`, `#events`, `#contact`: These will be the ids of the div elements in `index.html` that will contain the content for each section. They will be used in `main.js` to insert the content into the correct section.

4. Message Names: 
   - `contentLoaded`: This message will be emitted from `main.js` once the content from `content.py` has been loaded and the DOM has been updated. It can be used to trigger any additional JavaScript functionality that depends on the content being loaded.

5. Function Names: 
   - `loadContent()`: This function will be defined in `main.js`. It will be responsible for loading the content from `content.py` and updating the DOM.
   - `updateDOM()`: This function will also be defined in `main.js`. It will be called by `loadContent()` and will be responsible for inserting the content into the correct sections of the DOM.

6. CSS Classes and IDs: 
   - `.section`: This class will be used in `styles.css` to style the section divs in `index.html`.
   - `#navbar`: This id will be used in `styles.css` to style the navigation bar in `index.html`. It will also be used in `main.js` to dynamically generate the navigation links based on the `sections` variable.
